CHAPTER 3: WEBSITE STRUCTURE DESIGN

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling website content so users can easily find and understand information.

2. What is a “Wireframe”?
A wireframe is a simple visual blueprint of a webpage that shows layout, content placement, and navigation without detailed design or colors.

3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort required by users when a website is confusing, complex, or difficult to navigate.

4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Hyphens are preferred because search engines treat them as word separators, while underscores join words, making URLs more readable and SEO-friendly.

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.
Give an example of when to use each.
| Feature    | Hierarchical (Tree) Structure                              | Linear (Sequential) Structure                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layout     | Organizes pages in a **parent-child hierarchy**            | Pages are arranged in a **sequence/step-by-step order** |
| Navigation | Users can **branch out** to related pages                  | Users follow a **fixed path**                           |
| Use Case   | Suitable for **large websites** with categories            | Suitable for **tutorials, forms, or presentations**     |
| Example    | E-commerce site with categories → subcategories → products | Online course module or application form                |


6. Explain the ”Three-Click Rule” and its significance in User Experience (UX) design.
The Three-Click Rule states that users should be able to reach any page on a website within three clicks from the homepage.

Significance:
Reduces user frustration
Improves usability and navigation
Increases the likelihood of task completion
Enhances user satisfaction and engagement
Example:
An online store should allow users to find any product in 3 clicks or less.

7. ”Plan before you do.” Explain how tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning
a website’s structure.
Planning is essential to ensure an organized and user-friendly website.

Card Sorting:
Helps determine how content should be grouped
Users or designers organize topics/cards to understand user expectations

Flowcharts:
Show step-by-step user navigation and website workflow
Visualizes page hierarchy, linking, and decision paths

Benefit:
Both tools help create a clear structure, minimize confusion, and guide efficient website development.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. You are designing a website for a University. It has hundreds of pages (Admissions,
Departments, Alumni, News). Which structural model would you choose? Draw a rough
diagram and justify your choice.
Recommended Structure: Hierarchical (Tree) Structure

Justification:
A university website has hundreds of pages grouped under categories like Admissions, Departments, Alumni, News, etc.
Hierarchical structure allows easy navigation, with main categories branching into subcategories.
Users can reach any page in a logical way without confusion.

Rough Diagram:
Homepage
 ├─ Admissions
 │   ├─ Undergraduate
 │   └─ Postgraduate
 ├─ Departments
 │   ├─ Science
 │   └─ Arts
 ├─ Alumni
 └─ News
     ├─ Events
     └─ Announcements

Conclusion:
Hierarchical structure is scalable, organized, and user-friendly for large websites.

9. A user visits a website but leaves within 10 seconds because they cannot find the navigation
menu, which is hidden behind a small icon on a desktop screen. Analyze this design failure
using the ”KISS” (Keep It Simple) principle.
Scenario: User leaves the website quickly because the navigation menu is hidden behind a small icon.

Analysis using KISS (Keep It Simple):
KISS principle: Interfaces should be simple, intuitive, and easy to use.
Failure: Hiding navigation behind a tiny icon on desktop adds unnecessary complexity, increasing cognitive friction.
Users cannot easily find important links, leading to poor user experience.

Solution:
Display navigation prominently on desktop screens.
Reduce unnecessary hidden elements to simplify interaction.
Make menu intuitive and immediately visible.

10. An e-commerce website has a URL structure like www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9. Explain why this is bad for both users and Search Engines (SEO), and propose a better
structure using Page Slugs.
Current URL:
www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9

Problems:
Not readable for users; hard to remember.
Poor SEO: Search engines cannot easily understand the content.
Unfriendly sharing: Long and confusing URLs are harder to share.
Better Alternative using Page Slugs:
www.shop.com/electronics/smartphone-55

Advantages:
Readable and descriptive for users
SEO-friendly, as keywords are visible in URL
Easier to share and remember
