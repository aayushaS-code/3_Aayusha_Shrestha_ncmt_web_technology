CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)

1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.

Legibility: How easily individual letters or characters can be recognized.
Readability: How easily a block of text can be read and understood.

2. What is the “Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
The Rule of Thirds divides a layout into three equal horizontal and vertical sections, placing important elements along these lines or intersections to create balance and visual interest.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families used on a website?
Using too many fonts can make a website look cluttered, inconsistent, and unprofessional; limiting fonts improves visual coherence and user experience.

4. Define “Responsive Web Design.”
Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a design approach that ensures a website adapts smoothly to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience.

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. Explain the ”F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences the placement of content on a
web page.
The F-Pattern is a common way users scan web pages, discovered in usability studies.

Users tend to read:
Horizontally across the top (forming the top bar of the “F”)
Horizontally slightly lower (middle section of the “F”)
Vertically down the left side (forming the vertical bar of the “F”)

Influence on Content Placement:
Place important information, headings, and calls-to-action along the top and left side.
Less important content can go towards the right or lower parts of the page.
This improves usability and user engagement.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of where Blue,
Red, and Green should be used.
Colors affect user emotions, perception, and behavior.

Blue: Creates trust, calm, and professionalism
Use in: Banking websites, corporate pages, social media (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn)

Red: Creates urgency, excitement, and attention
Use in: Sale buttons, alerts, food promotions

Green: Creates growth, health, and relaxation
Use in: Environmental websites, health/fitness apps, success messages

Conclusion:
Choosing colors strategically enhances user experience and brand perception

7. Explain the ”60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.
The 60-30-10 Rule is a guideline for color distribution on a website:

60% – Dominant Color: Background or main areas
30% – Secondary Color: Highlights sections, menus, or blocks
10% – Accent Color: Buttons, calls-to-action, or highlights

Purpose:
Creates visual balance
Prevents overwhelming the user
Improves readability and aesthetic appeal

Example:
Website background: Light gray (60%)
Sidebar/menu: Dark blue (30%)
Buttons/links: Red (10%)

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. A website loads very slowly, causing users to abandon it. Upon inspection, you find the
developer used high-resolution raw images directly from a camera. Explain the importance
of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG) to solve this.
Scenario: Website loads slowly due to high-resolution raw images.

Explanation:
Image Optimization reduces file size without significantly affecting quality, improving page load speed.

File Formats:
JPEG: Best for photos; smaller file size, good quality
PNG: Best for graphics with transparency; larger file size

Solution:
Compress images before uploading
Choose JPEG for photos and PNG for logos/icons
This improves performance, user experience, and SEO.

9. You are designing a website for a Law Firm. The client wants to use a bright yellow background with Comic Sans font to look ”friendly.” As a web designer, critique this choice based on Color Theory and Typography principles, and suggest a better alternative.
Scenario: Law Firm wants bright yellow + Comic Sans.

Critique:

Color Theory: Bright yellow is too intense for a professional law website; it can cause eye strain and reduce credibility.
Typography: Comic Sans appears informal and unprofessional, unsuitable for legal services.

Better Alternative:
Color: Use neutral/professional colors (e.g., navy blue, dark gray, white background)
Font: Use serif or clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, Roboto, Open Sans)
Ensures trustworthiness, readability, and professional impression.

10. A website looks great on a laptop but is unreadable on a mobile phone because the user has to zoom in and scroll horizontally. Identify the design principle missing here and explain how Media Queries/Fluid Grids could fix it.

Scenario: Website is unreadable on mobile.

Missing Principle: Responsive Web Design (RWD) – the site should adapt to different screen sizes.
How to Fix:
Media Queries: Apply different CSS rules for different device widths

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    body { font-size: 14px; }
    .container { width: 100%; }
}

Fluid Grids: Use percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels to allow elements to resize proportionally.

Outcome:
Website becomes mobile-friendly, readable, and scroll-free horizontally.
Enhances user experience across all devices.
