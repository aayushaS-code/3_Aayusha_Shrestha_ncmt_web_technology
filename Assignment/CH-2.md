CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Group A: Short Questions (2 Marks)
1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.
A sitemap is a structured diagram or list that shows the hierarchy and relationship between all web pages of a website, created during the planning phase

2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?
The launch phase involves making the website live on the server so that it becomes accessible to users on the Internet.

3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
Documentation is important because it records system details, making future maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting easier.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
| Front-end Development | Back-end Development |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Client-side           | Server-side          |
| User interface        | Logic and database   |
| Uses HTML, CSS, JS    | Uses PHP, Java, Node |
| Runs in browser       | Runs on server       |

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)

5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
Planning is considered the most critical phase of web development because it lays the foundation for all subsequent stages. Mistakes in planning can lead to higher costs and redesign later.
Key activities in the planning phase include:
Defining goals and objectives of the website.
Identifying target users and their requirements.
Creating a sitemap to organize website structure.
Selecting technologies, tools, and resources.
Estimating budget, timeline, and responsibilities.
Proper planning ensures efficient development, reduced errors, and successful project completion.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly
”finished”?
The maintenance phase is iterative because it continues even after the website is launched.
User feedback leads to improvements.
Bugs and errors must be fixed regularly.
Content needs updating to remain relevant.
Security updates and performance optimizations are required.
A website is never truly “finished” because technology, user needs, and business goals continuously change, requiring ongoing updates and enhancements.

7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
Information gathering is the process of collecting all necessary details before designing and developing a website.

The process includes:
Identifying client requirements and goals.
Collecting content such as text, images, and data.
Studying competitors and similar websites.
Understanding user expectations and behavior.

Understanding the target audience is crucial because it influences:
Website design and layout.
Content tone and language.
Navigation and functionality.

This ensures the website meets user needs and achieves its objectives.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the
”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining
the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.

Skipping the Testing phase to save money and launch early can lead to serious long-term problems.
Security Risks:
Without testing, vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, weak authentication, and data leaks may remain, risking customer and payment data.
Functionality Issues:
Features like shopping cart, payment gateway, and order confirmation may not work correctly, causing transaction failures.
Compatibility Problems:
The site may not function properly on different browsers, devices, or screen sizes, leading to poor user experience.
Conclusion:
Testing ensures reliability, security, and customer trust. Skipping it may cause financial loss, reputational damage, and higher future costs than proper testing.

9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating
a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze
what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.

The developer skipped the planning and design phases by not creating:

A sitemap (site structure)
A design prototype or wireframe
As a result, the client’s expectations were not clearly understood, leading to rejection of the layout midway through development.

How It Should Have Been Handled:
Conduct proper information gathering
Create and get approval for wireframes and prototypes
Finalize the sitemap and layout before coding
Begin development only after client approval

This approach would have saved time, cost, and avoided rework

10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped
visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development
lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.

Neglected Phase:
Maintenance Phase

Explanation:
Although the website was launched successfully, exam schedules were not updated, causing students to lose interest.

Activities Involved in the Maintenance Phase:
Updating content regularly
Fixing errors and broken links
Improving performance and security
Responding to user feedback

Conclusion:
Regular maintenance keeps a website relevant and useful. Neglecting this phase results in outdated information and reduced user engagement.
